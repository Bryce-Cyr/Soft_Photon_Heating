This Jupyter notebook allows one to study the effects of soft photon heating as described in 2024.xxxx.

Soft-Photon-Heating.ipynb:
Contains the main elements necessary to investigate the response of the matter temperature (T_M), ionization fraction (X_e), and spectral distortion (\Delta n) to the injection of soft photon backgrounds.

To use: modify relevant sections in the 'User Input Section' cell, and then run rest of the cells.
Plots of T_M and X_e compare against pre-tabulated solutions from CosmoRec (vanilla LCDM).
The cosmos.py contains details of most of the function calls used by the solver.
